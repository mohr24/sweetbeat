My idea is derived from "PATAPON".

Any instructions to the character are given by a piece of music.

I build a little demo about this idea.

When you touch a note on the map, you get a new music note to play. 
Press any key to assign it to this note.

When you touch a star, you get a new piece of music to give order (like move, jump).
You can click the star to verify the instruction.
